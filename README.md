## Background

- CCC Senior 2025: **75 / 75**, invited to the Canadian Computing Olympiad  
- USACO **Platinum** (2025)  
- IChO Team Alternate  

Primary interests include algorithmic problem solving, systems-level programming, and full-stack application development. Outside computing, I study the natural sciences and play classical piano.

## Selected Projects

### Competitive_Programming  
**Language:** C++  
**Focus:** Algorithmic problem solving, contest preparation  

This repository contains structured solutions to Canadian Computing Competition, USACO, and IOI-style problems. Emphasis is placed on asymptotic efficiency, correctness proofs, and implementation clarity. Solutions frequently involve advanced data structures, dynamic programming optimizations, and graph algorithms. The codebase is organized by contest and problem category to support systematic training.

Repository: https://github.com/smiles0527/Competitive_Programming

### HASO-simulation  
**Language:** Python  
**Focus:** Graph modeling and simulation  

A simulation system modeling evacuation and routing behavior using weighted graphs. The project explores shortest-path variants, congestion modeling, and scenario-based simulation. It demonstrates practical application of graph theory concepts beyond competitive programming, with attention to modularity and experimental analysis.
